For every $1000 gross income, a person can borrow $77,165.985. 
The amount comes from the formula :

The calculation is based on 
mortgage rate: 3.81% (Feb 7th, 2015 Seattle Ave)
mortgage length: 30 fixed-rate
debt-to-income ratio: 36%

Assume a person has monthly pre-tax income of amount I, the amount he could borrow (X1) is estimated at:
77
Assume a person has X in savings, he needs to set amount aside for emergency. So we took 20% or 20,000, whichever is greater
as the emergency funds. The remainder is what he could spend for downpayment, X2.

The total a person could spend is:
total = X1 + X2;

However, this amount has not taken into the account of home insurance and property tax. 
the property tax for WA is 0.941%.
